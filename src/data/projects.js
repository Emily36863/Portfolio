I developed practical skills in version control, Android Studio, Material Design, and Room Database, while learning how to structure an app effectively.\n\n My research into behavioural psychology and habit formation, drawing on works such as Atomic Habits, showed that sustainable habit-building depends on positive reinforcement and personalisation, not punishment. Apps that penalise users (e.g., streak breaks or lost points) can discourage long-term engagement. I applied this by designing a system that rewards progress, lets users define their own rewards, and focuses on intrinsic motivation.\n\n Combining this research with practical development taught me how to align design and technology to support genuine behaviour change ‚Äî building an app that motivates users through clarity, autonomy, and reward, rather than guilt.",
